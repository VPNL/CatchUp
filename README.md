# CatchUp

This code reproduces all Figures included in our manuscript titled "Catch me if you can: Least myelinated white matter develops fastest during early infancy". The manuscript is currently in preparation. The code for each plot pulls the data from ./Data directory and creates a figure which is saved in the ./Output directory.
